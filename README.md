# hello-genai

A simple chatbot web application built in Go, Python and Node.js that connects to a local LLM service (llama.cpp) to provide AI-powered responses.

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables defined in the `.env` file:

- `LLM_BASE_URL`: The base URL of the LLM API
- `LLM_MODEL_NAME`: The model name to use

To change these settings, simply edit the `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

## Quick Start

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/docker/hello-genai
   cd hello-genai
   ```

2. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
